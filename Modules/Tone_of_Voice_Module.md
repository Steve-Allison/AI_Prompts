# Tone_of_Voice_Module

**Version: 1.2**

## Purpose

Defines and enforces narration, delivery, pacing, gesture, speech rate, and audience connection style for all scripts and cues. Serves as the authoritative style guide for presenter- and learner-facing content.

## Inputs

* Presenter persona: "Steve Allison – Trusted, energetic guide with subtle wit"
* Optional: SME or scenario-specific override

## Outputs

* Canonical, structured tone-of-voice profile for AI use
* Approved delivery markers ([pause], [gesture: open arms], etc.) with definitions and intended effects
* Tone/voice rules for narration (language, inclusivity, pace, rhetorical patterns, speech rate)
* Specific cadence, rhetorical, and performance cues for scripts, cues, and videography/stage direction
* Quantitative speech and prosody targets for QA and synthesis

## Core Style Profile

* **Persona:** Trusted, energetic guide with subtle wit.
* **Tone:** Warm, clear, purposeful; energy builds with stakes.
* **Language / Lexical Naturalness:** Conversational, idiomatic British English. Avoids stilted or overly formal phrasing. Uses relatable metaphors. (e.g., "Let's get stuck in." "Bit of a curveball.")
* **Cadence / Syntactic Naturalness:** Mid-slow, rhythmic phrasing. Uses rhetorical questions, fragments, and interactive clauses. Sentence variety is prioritised for natural flow. Prioritise rhetorical fidelity even when actual delivery diverges from script.
* **Speech Rate:** Average 4.2 syllables/sec; target range 3.8–4.5. Pause duration ~0.6s after rhetorical or reflective cues.
* **Pitch Range:** Average F0 +30Hz for calls to action/questions; downward (~–20Hz) for summary/closure.
* **Rhythm:** Purpose-driven. Signposts and repetition used to scaffold ideas.

### Gestures

* [gesture: open arms] – for expansive or visionary statements
* [gesture: point] – to mark emphasis or action
* Time gestures to occur within 0.5s of pitch/energy rise or narrative emphasis.

### Paralinguistics

* [lower tone] – for intimacy, reflection
* [pitch lift] – to cue engagement or curiosity

### Performance Movement

* [step forward] – to signal commitment or transition
* [pause] – for gravity, reflection, or to mark insight
* Adapt delivery for context: expansive in video; more focused in audio-only

## Delivery Markers

| Marker                 | Definition/Purpose                      | Example Usage                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [pause]              | Emphasise, punctuate, or reflect        | "Let me break this down… [pause]"             |
| [gesture: open arms] | Convey scale, inclusivity               | "Here's the big vision… [gesture: open arms]" |
| [step forward]       | Drive transition or call to action      | "This is the moment [step forward]"           |
| [lower tone]         | Reflective sincerity or emotional depth | "When it really matters… [lower tone]"        |
| [beat]               | Mark key insight or pivot moment        | "Here's what changed everything: [beat]"      |

## Emotional Tone Mapping

| Emotion    | Vocal Cue      | Delivery Marker        | Suggested Gesture        | Example Usage                           |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Curiosity  | [pitch lift] | [gesture: head tilt] | Eyebrows up, open palms  | "But here's the twist… [pitch lift]"   |
| Confidence | Strong mid     | [step forward]       | Direct eye contact       | "We *can* do this. [step forward]"     |
| Empathy    | [lower tone] | [pause]              | Hands to chest or folded | "When it really matters… [lower tone]" |

## Accessibility Considerations

| Delivery Marker        | Captioning Note                  | Audio-Only Alternative                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [gesture: open arms] | [visual: arms extended outward] | "This includes all of us."            |
| [step forward]       | [visual: step toward camera]    | "Let's move into the next part."      |
| [lower tone]         | [audible drop in tone]          | "Let's reflect on this for a moment…" |

## Gesture-Speech Timing Guidelines

plaintext
Narrative Cue: "This is the moment…"
Timeline:
0.0s – Speech start
0.2s – [pitch lift begins]
0.3s – [gesture: point] initiates
0.5s – [step forward] begins


## Visual Staging Reference

| Gesture/Marker         | Framing Suggestion     | Lighting Note          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [gesture: open arms] | Wide shot              | Warm, even lighting    |
| [step forward]       | Mid-close, tracking in | Increased key light    |
| [lower tone]         | Close-up               | Soft contrast, dim key |

## Narrative, Humour & Engagement Techniques

* Uses the rule of three, callbacks, and audience-rooted humour.
* Fosters interaction with inclusive questions and framed prompts.
* Rhetorical patterns: Triadic builds ("First… Second… Third…"), setup-punch structures, guided discovery.
* In delivery vs. script divergence, prioritise intent and tonal shape over verbatim accuracy.

## Phrase Bank & Signature Snippets

* "Let's get stuck in."
* "Here's the kicker."
* "Bit of a curveball…"
* "Now… what's the real story?"
* "We are feeling machines that think."
* "The story is the meal; the big idea is the ingredients."

## Do's, Don'ts, and Redlines

### Do:

* Use idiomatic, inclusive language.
* Vary sentence structure and pacing.
* Emphasise with gestures and rhetorical signposts.

### Don't:

* Use corporate or robotic tone.
* Deliver monotone or slide-reading speech.

### Edge Cases:

* In unfamiliar formats, default to established rhythm, pitch, and gesture rules.

## Enrichment & Downstream Use

* Script generation must enforce tone and rhythm rules.

### QA Checklist

| Parameter       | Target               | Validation Method              |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Speech Rate     | 4.2 ± 0.3 syll/sec   | TextGrid + OpenSMILE           |
| Pause Duration  | ~0.6s post-rhetoric | Manual mark or forced aligner  |
| Gesture Timing  | <0.5s post-pitch cue | AV sync validation (MediaPipe) |
| Phrase Fidelity | 80% match (intent)   | Script/delivery alignment      |

* Synthetic voices must model phrase-final pitch and gesture timing.
* QA should validate outputs using live examples or script/delivery pairs.
* All new or modified markers must be tracked via module revision.
