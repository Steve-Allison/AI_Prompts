### S
- **Scaffolding**: Temporary support provided to learners to help them achieve a learning goal.
- **Summative Assessment**: Evaluations used to measure student learning at the end of an instructional unit.
- **Synchronous Learning**: Learning that occurs in real-time with instructor and students interacting simultaneously.

### T
- **Threshold Concept**: A core idea that is essential for understanding a subject but may be challenging for learners.
- **Transfer**: The application of knowledge and skills learned in one context to another context.

## Module-Specific Terms
