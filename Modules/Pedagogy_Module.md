\*Pedagogy_Module\*\*

**Version:** 1.3

**Role:** Instructional Design QA & Validation Layer

## Purpose

The Pedagogy_Module serves as a logic and validation layer for all learning objectives, scripts, activities, assessments, and assets generated across the workflow. It ensures:

- Measurable outcomes
- Robust scaffolding
- Framework alignment (Bloom, Gagné, Kirkpatrick, ARCS, Merrill, UDL, Dialogic, Constructive Alignment, Mayer, Action Mapping, ZPD, UX)
- Accessibility compliance
- Full traceability for review and audit

## Inputs

Required:

- Learning objectives (must be SMART/ABCD and Bloom-compliant)

Optional (if available):

- Script content (for segment-level mapping)
- Module outline (for structure validation)
- Learning activities or assets
- Assessments (formative/summative)
- Cue/tag metadata (e.g., from Cognitive Keyword Watchlist)
- Reviewer/SME notes or audit history

## Outputs

### A. Validation Table (Per Objective/Segment)

A structured table linking pedagogical indicators to instructional segments, with QA fields and remediation notes. Includes:

- Dialogic Principles (Alexander)
- Constructive Alignment Check
- SOLO Taxonomy Level (optional)
- ZPD Challenge Tag
- Multimedia & Visual Design QA (Mayer, CRAP, UX)

### B. Automated or Reviewer-Supported Remediation Suggestions

Common suggestions include:

- Insert a formative quiz after 'Present Content' (Gagné: Provide Feedback)
- Add visual analog to support 'Confidence' (ARCS)
- Ensure objective includes measurable Bloom verb
- Add demonstration task to meet Merrill's Principles
- Insert a dialogic or metacognitive question to support learner agency
- Align assessment activity with stated Bloom level (Constructive Alignment)
- Add scaffolding or reduce load to bring activity into ZPD
- Remove decorative media (Mayer: Coherence)
- Realign visual layout (CRAP) for usability or clarity
- Add reflective prompt using Gibbs' Cycle

### C. Traceability Appendix

Matrix mapping learning objectives to:

- Script segments
- Activities
- Assessment types
- Cue tags
- Motivation strategies
- Accessibility features
- Merrill, Dialogic, SOLO, Constructive Alignment, Multimedia/UX, ZPD indicators

## Validation Logic / QA Rules

### Objective Integrity

- Valid Bloom-level verb
- SMART or ABCD compliant
- Clear, measurable outcomes

### Gagné Events

- Minimum 5 of 9 Gagné events per module
- Mapped to concrete instructional actions

### Practice and Feedback

- No passive instruction exceeding 5–10 minutes
- Triggers recommendation for active learning if exceeded

### Kirkpatrick Mapping

- Each outcome aligned to L1–L4
- Requires matching artefact

### ARCS Motivation

- Document implementation of Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction

### Merrill’s First Principles (Extended)

- Checklist of five:

  - Task-centred learning
  - Activation of prior knowledge
  - Demonstration of new knowledge
  - Application through active use
  - Integration into real-world context

- At least 3 of 5 must be evidenced per objective/module

### Accessibility (UDL-Aligned)

- Captions or transcripts
- Screen reader compatibility
- Colour contrast (WCAG)
- ALT text
- Flexible navigation/pacing
- Multiple representation modes

### Dialogic Teaching (Alexander)

- At least one dialogic move (questioning, reasoning, exploratory talk) per session/module
- QA flag if absent

### Constructive Alignment (Biggs & Tang)

- Outcome verb, instructional task, and assessment must be matched in Bloom level
- QA fail if misalignment detected

### SOLO Taxonomy (Optional Tagging)

- Optionally tag each objective or segment with SOLO stage (Prestructural to Extended Abstract)
- Use for deeper scaffolding and learner progression mapping

### Mayer’s Multimedia Principles

- Apply coherence, signaling, redundancy, spatial/temporal contiguity principles
- QA field: Are multimedia elements instructionally aligned and cognitively optimized?

### Visual Design & UX (CRAP + Honeycomb Model)

- Review Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity
- Check usability, usefulness, desirability, accessibility, credibility
- QA checklist per asset

### Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)

- Check that task difficulty falls within learner’s ZPD with available scaffolds
- Add scaffolding, reduce complexity, or revise sequence if out of range

### Cathy Moore’s Action Mapping

- QA field: “Mapped to real-world job task?”
- Flag if objective lacks practical, action-based relevance

### Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle

- Include structured reflection opportunity post-performance or assessment
- Suggest using Gibbs’ stages (Describe, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, Action Plan)

## Reviewer Features

- Editable fields for comment and signoff
- Version tracking
- Flagging failed validations for review
- SME notes recorded for traceability

## Error Handling

- Halt if objectives are missing or unclear
- Auto-suggest revisions for failed validations; require SME action

## Integration and Enrichment Use Cases

### Script Generator Module

- Failed validations used to dynamically insert narration changes, scaffolding cues, feedback loops, examples, dialogic questions, or reflective prompts

### Learning_Theories_Checklist_Module

- Pulls validation tags for theoretical coverage analysis
- Flags underrepresented cognitive, motivational, visual, or dialogic categories

### Learning_Asset_Module

- Triggers asset generation logic when QA fails (e.g., missing demonstration = suggest animation)
- Classifies remediation type for automated prompts based on theory-backed tag sets (e.g., ZPD support, Mayer principle)

### Reviewer Tables and Appendices

- Auto-generated validation matrix exportable for audits or design reviews
- Includes Merrill, SOLO, Dialogic, Constructive Alignment, Mayer, UX, ZPD checks

### Central Reviewer Dashboard

- Aggregate QA status across modules
- Preview effects of failed validations on scripts and assets
- Export audit-ready bundles (validation table, theory alignment, asset prompts)
