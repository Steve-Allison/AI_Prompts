# Learner_Outcomes_Module

## Purpose:

Generate, validate, or revise comprehensive Learning Gaps, Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes (GGOO) for instructional videos or courses. Ensure clarity, traceability, SMART/ABCD compliance, alignment with performance and learning theory, and seamless integration with downstream workflow modules and audit processes.

## Inputs

    • Mandatory:
    	○ Course theme/title
    	○ Performance gap: clearly define what learners cannot currently do, including root cause if known.
    • Optional but Recommended:
    	○ Target behavior or specific post-course action.
    	○ Existing GGOO elements (for revision/validation).
    	○ Audience/job context (for tailored objectives).
    	○ Business/job KPIs or performance benchmarks.
    	○ Persona context (learner needs, motivations).

## Outputs

    • A. Gap Statement
    	○ Clearly identifies the performance or knowledge gap.
    	○ Includes baseline and target metrics, if available.
    • B. Learning Goal
    	○ Strategic, broad aim addressing the defined gap.
    	○ Explicitly action-oriented, clearly linking gap to outcomes.
    • C. Learning Objectives
    	○ ABCD-based, SMART objectives at the module or lesson level.
    	○ Clearly mapped to Bloom’s Taxonomy, Gagné events, Kirkpatrick levels, ARCS model, and other relevant frameworks.
    	○ Tagged by performance level, assessment type, priority, complexity, and estimated completion time.
    • D. Learning Outcome
    	○ Clearly articulated real-world behavior change expected post-training.
    	○ Specified metrics, timeframe, and validation method/evidence.

## Adaptive Validation Features

    • SMART/ABCD Validation:
    	○ Automatically flags vague or non-actionable objectives.
    	○ Provides specific examples and recommended improvements.
    • Traceability Matrix:
    	○ Clearly links each learning outcome to objectives, goals, and gap statements, establishing a transparent audit trail.
    • Change Tracking:
    	○ Records all updates to GGOO elements, including reviewer notes, SME annotations, and date/version tracking.

## Reviewer/Audit Tools

    • Editable reviewer/SME fields for signoff, comments, and validation notes.
    • Compliance Checklist:
    	○ Is the gap clearly defined and aligned with business/learner needs?
    	○ Is the goal actionable, clear, and outcome-oriented?
    	○ Are objectives measurable, observable, realistic, and aligned with frameworks?
    	○ Are outcomes traceable to real-world impact and assessment methods?
    • Signature/date section for final approval.

| Type      | Statement                                                                                                                            | Bloom Level | Kirkpatrick | Gagné Event(s) | ARCS | Priority | Complexity | Est. Completion | Reviewer Note                    | Signoff/Date |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Gap       | New hires fail to escalate tickets due to lack of decision tree knowledge. Baseline: 60% errors. Target: ≤10% errors within 30 days. | N/A         | N/A         | N/A            | N/A  | High     | Moderate   | N/A             | Confirm baseline accuracy.       |              |
| Goal      | Enable accurate ticket triage/escalation using company SOPs.                                                                         | N/A         | L3          | N/A            | R    | High     | Moderate   | 30 days         | Validate SOP relevance.          |              |
| Objective | By end of Module 2, agents correctly identify escalation types with 95% accuracy using provided decision tree.                       | Apply       | L2          | Present/Elicit | C,S  | High     | Low        | 60 minutes      | Adjust decision tree if unclear. |              |
| Outcome   | Within 30 days, agents accurately escalate 90% of tickets as measured by audit logs and supervisory review.                          | Analyze     | L3          | Transfer       | R,S  | High     | Moderate   | 30 days         | Schedule audit review.           |              |


## Error Handling Guidance
• If mandatory inputs (e.g., gap statement) are missing, immediately prompt for clarification, providing an example for reference.
• If objectives fail SMART/ABCD validation, offer detailed feedback and suggest clear, actionable improvements for SMEs/LxDs to review.
Examples of SMART/ABCD Corrections:
• Unclear Objective: "Learners understand escalation."
• Improved Objective: "By end of Module 1, learners identify escalation criteria correctly on 85% of practice scenarios."
