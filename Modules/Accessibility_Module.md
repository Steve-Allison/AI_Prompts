# Accessibility_Module

Version 1.4

**Purpose**
Applies WCAG-compliant adaptations and visual guidelines, ensuring content accessibility and inclusivity.

**Integration Notes**
Integrated during visual asset reviews and script production checks. Explicitly activated during the review of outputs from Learning_Activity_Generator_Module and Learning_Asset_Module. Flags should trigger detailed accessibility reviews within these modules before deployment.

**Input Parameters**

* content: Text or visual content for accessibility evaluation.
* target_wcag_level: Desired WCAG compliance level (AA or AAA).

**Key Returns**

* **accessibility_flags**
  Flags identifying specific accessibility issues, such as:

  * missing_alt_text
  * insufficient_contrast
  * poor_caption_timing
  * complex_language
  * interactive_activity_usability (e.g., drag-and-drop activities)
  * audio_visual_dependency
  * modality_mismatch

  Each flag includes a severity rating:

  * **Critical:** Immediate fix required.
  * **High:** Fix as soon as possible.
  * **Medium:** Important but lower urgency.
  * **Low:** Recommended improvement for enhanced accessibility.

  **Modality Mismatch Examples:**

  * Visual-only activity lacking auditory/textual alternatives.
  * Audio-only assessment without text transcripts or captions.
  * Interactive activities not providing accessible alternatives.

* **alt_text_description**
  Clear, descriptive alternative text recommendations for visual content.

  *Example:*
  *Visual:* "An infographic displaying global warming data."
  *Alt Text:* "Bar chart infographic showing global temperature rise from 2000 to 2025."

* **contrast_guidance**
  Recommended adjustments for text and background colors to achieve WCAG compliance.

  *Example:*
  *Original Contrast:* Gray text on white background (2.8:1)
  *Recommended Contrast:* Black text (#000000) on white background (#FFFFFF) (21:1)

* **caption_style**
  Optimal styling guidelines for subtitles and captions, covering font, size, background, opacity, placement, and timing.

  *Example:*
  "White sans-serif text, 20px, with black transparent box (60% opacity), positioned bottom-center."

* **reading_level**
  Assessment of textual complexity and readability, offering simplified alternatives.

  *Example:*
  *Original:* "Utilizing multifaceted analytics tools enhances interpretive capabilities."
  *Simplified:* "Using different analytics tools makes data easier to understand."

**Additional Enhancements**

* **Automated Validation**
  Recommend integrating automated validation tools (e.g., [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)) alongside manual checks.

* **Reference Guidelines**
  Include direct references to [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) to streamline compliance verification.

* **Standardized Outputs**
  Suggest standardized output formats such as structured JSON or ARIA-compliant tags for ease of implementation.

* **Supporting Resources**
  Provide curated accessibility resources and guidelines for ongoing learning and improvement.

**Enhanced Accessibility Checks for Learning Activities**

* **Interactive Activities:** Provide keyboard-accessible alternatives for mouse-driven interactions such as drag-and-drop.
* **Simulations and Interactive Modules:** Include descriptive text or simplified interaction alternatives.
* **Audio-Visual Activities:** Provide comprehensive text equivalents or transcripts.
* **Modality Mismatch:** Explicitly flag when activity modality does not align with accessibility standards or lacks adequate alternatives.

**Best Practices**

* Integrate early and iteratively through production.
* Ensure consistency across assets.
* Continuously update according to evolving WCAG guidelines.
