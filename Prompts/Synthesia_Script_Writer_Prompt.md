# Synthesia Script Generator – AI Prompt

(British Presenter | Instructional & Persuasive | Synthesia-Optimised | API-Ready)

🎯 Purpose
Generate a 6–9 minute spoken script optimised for Synthesia AI avatar videos. This prompt supports both instructional and persuasive content, and is compatible with Synthesia’s editor and API. It integrates:
• Mayer’s multimedia learning principles (for instructional videos)
• Monroe’s Motivated Sequence (for persuasive videos)
• Synthesia’s expressive avatar scripting features
• A clear, performative British Presenter tone

📥 Required Inputs 1. ✅ Outline Document – With clear, descriptive, human-readable section titles (no numbering) 2. ✅ Learning Design Checklist (required for instructional use)
⚠️ Do not begin script generation until both inputs are confirmed.

📝 AI Instructions
📚 Script Structure
• Each scene must be a single paragraph.
• Use hard paragraph breaks (\n\n) between scenes.
• Use soft line breaks within scenes to allow natural flow (\n).
• Scene titles should be descriptive, not numbered (e.g., “Engage the emotional brain”).
• Do not include word counts, timings, or section numbers.
🎙️ Tone & Voice: British Presenter (Embedded)
• British English throughout.
• Confident, warm, articulate – like a trusted peer on stage.
• Conversational rhythm: use triads, rhetorical questions, and purposeful pauses.
• Common idioms are encouraged: “Let’s get stuck in”, “bit of a curveball”.
• Natural cadence: slight lift on curiosity, drop on emphasis. Pause using [pause].
• Inclusive language: “We’re in this together”, “You and I both know…”
🤖 Synthesia-Specific Enhancements
• Paragraph = Scene: Ensure each new paragraph represents a new Synthesia scene.
• Use expressive punctuation:
○ ! for enthusiasm
○ ? to signal curiosity
○ ... for suspense or reflection
• Insert [pause] for natural rhythm
• Use emotive symbols Synthesia recognises:
○ :) or :-) – happy tone
○ :( or :-( – concern/sadness
• Avoid markdown, formatting symbols, or headings that will be read aloud by avatars.
🧠 Instructional vs Persuasive
• Instructional: Apply Mayer’s principles – segmentation, signalling, personalisation, coherence.
• Persuasive: Follow Monroe’s Motivated Sequence: 1. Attention – start with curiosity or story 2. Need – present a relatable problem 3. Satisfaction – offer a solution 4. Visualisation – contrast outcomes 5. Action – clear next step

📦 Output Format (for AI)
Each script section should follow this format:

## [Scene Title]

[Scene direction: e.g., "Mid-shot – avatar smiles :)"]
Spoken script text, using soft line breaks.
Lower-third: [Optional caption text]
Each paragraph becomes one Synthesia scene.
Soft line breaks keep flow natural; hard breaks separate scenes.
Do not include timing information.

🧬 Compatibility Notes
This prompt is designed for full interoperability with Synthesia’s video creation tools:
• All scripts are scene-ready: one paragraph per scene
• Compatible with API upload and template-driven generation
• Encourages expressive avatar behaviour for enhanced viewer engagement

✅ Final Usage Prompt
Please generate a Synthesia-ready instructional or persuasive script using the following:
– Outline: {{Insert content or filename}}
– Learning Design: {{Insert content or filename (if instructional)}}
Follow the AI instructions above. Each paragraph should be a new scene, with expressive punctuation, emotive indicators, and British Presenter tone.
Do not include timings, section numbers, or formatting that will interfere with Synthesia rendering.
