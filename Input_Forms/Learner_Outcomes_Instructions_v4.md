# Instructions for Creating Learner Gaps, Goals,

Outcomes and Objectives

## 1.1 Overview

This guide defines and differentiates four key components in outcome-based instructional design: Learning Gaps, Learning Goals, Learning Outcomes, and Learning Objectives. Each component connects to the others

with enhancements for clearer comprehension, measurable impact, and rigorous validation.

Use this document to generate aligned Learning Gaps, Goals, Outcomes, and Objectives (GGOO). Objectives are macro-level (course and module), while Outcomes are written at the topic and sub-topic level. Ensure all items are SMART, ABCD-compliant, and aligned with a measurable performance gap.

## 1.2 Inputs

### 1.2.1 Mandatory Inputs:

Course theme/title

Clearly defined performance gap (including baseline and target metrics)

### 1.2.2 Optional but Recommended Inputs:

Target behavior or specific post-course actions

Existing GGOO elements (for revision/validation)

Audience/job context

Business/job KPIs or performance benchmarks

Persona context (learner motivations and needs)

## 1.3 Learning Gap – Why the Course Exists

Definition: A clearly identified current performance shortfall requiring immediate intervention.

### 1.3.1 Key Elements:

- Observable, underperformed action (e.g., troubleshoot, categorise).
- Frame the verb using Cathy Moore’s Action Mapping.
- Current baseline metric and desired target.
- Root cause analysis (Knowledge/Skill, Environment/Process, Motivation).
- Business impact if unresolved.
- Data source and benchmark.

Enhanced Example:

- Current customer satisfaction score: 70% (target: 85%).

Root cause: Inadequate troubleshooting skills among support agents.

Business impact: Risk of customer attrition and reduced revenue.

Purpose: Justifies the course by diagnosing the real-world issue.

Analogy: The Diagnosis.

## 1.4 Learning Goal – Course Vision

Definition: A broad, strategic statement aligned with solving the Learning Gap.

### 1.4.1 Key Elements:

Links to performance need.

Aligns with Bloom’s Taxonomy, Gagné’s Events, and Action Mapping.

May reference the KPI identified in the Gap.

Enhanced Example:

- Equip customer support agents with advanced troubleshooting techniques to increase customer satisfaction scores to 85% or higher within three months post-training.

Purpose: Expresses the course's intent and overarching direction.

Analogy: The Vision.

## 1.5 Learning Objective – What Learners Will Do During the Course

Definition: Performance targets guiding instruction and assessment.

### 1.5.1 Key Elements:

Follows the ABCD model:

- Audience: Who performs the action.
- Behaviour: Observable verb and object.
- Condition: Tools, scenarios, or context.
- Degree: Performance standard or accuracy.

Meets SMART criteria:

Specific | Measurable | Achievable | Relevant | Time-bound

Aligns with the Outcomes it supports.

### 1.5.2 Granularity:

Course-level Objectives define overarching capabilities.

Module-level Objectives specify discrete performance expectations.

Enhanced Example:

- Given realistic customer scenarios (Condition), customer support agents (Audience) will demonstrate effective troubleshooting skills (Behaviour) correctly in at least 90% of simulated interactions (Degree).

Instructional Activities:

- Scenario role-play simulations
- Interactive case studies with immediate feedback
- Practical workshops

Purpose: Drives instructional strategy and assessment planning.

Analogy: The Training Plan.

## 1.6 Learning Outcome – Real-world Performance Post-course

Definition: Observable, measurable change in performance or behaviour after training.

### 1.6.1 Key Elements:

- Observable verb (Bloom/psychomotor/affective)

- KPI or frequency/quality target

- Authentic metric source (dashboard, manager feedback)

- Time window for validation

- Meets SMART criteria

### 1.6.2 Granularity:

Outcomes at Topic and Sub-topic levels.

Enhanced Example:

- Within 30 days post-training, agents will increase troubleshooting accuracy, elevating customer satisfaction from 70% to 85%, verified by dashboards and manager reviews.

Purpose: Provides measurable proof of change in real-world settings.

Analogy: The Destination.

## 1.7 Reviewer/Audit Tools

Editable reviewer/SME fields for signoff, comments, and validation notes.

Compliance Checklist:

- Gap clearly defined and aligned with business/learner needs?
- Goal actionable, clear, and outcome-oriented?
- Objectives measurable, observable, realistic, aligned with frameworks?
- Outcomes traceable to real-world impact and assessment methods?
- Signature and date section for final approval.

## 1.8 Reinforcement Aids

### 1.8.1 Flow Summary

Gap → Goal → Objective → Outcome

Gap identifies what’s broken.

Goal sets the vision for success.

Objective defines in-course skills enabling Outcome.

Outcome states post-training change.

### 1.8.2 Mnemonic

G-G-O-O: "Find the problem, aim for change, measure results, train the skill."

## 1.9 Instructional Design Enhancements

### 1.9.1 Adult/Corporate Learning Design Lens

Self-directed, experiential, relevant, readiness, motivational, applicable

Real-world scenarios, autonomy, practical problems

### 1.9.2 Authentic Assessment Mapping

Formative assessments support Objectives.

Summative assessments validate Outcomes.

### 1.9.3 Accessibility Considerations

Closed captions/transcripts

Screen reader compatibility

Readability CEFR B2 level

### 1.9.4 Stakeholder & SME Collaboration

SME alignment workshops

Stakeholder feedback checkpoints

## 1.10 AI Prompting & QA Toolkit

SMART/ABCD Validation

Traceability Matrix

Change Tracking

Error Handling Guidance

## 1.11 Enhanced Sample Output Table

(Insert detailed table as provided in module documentation.)

## 1.12 Examples of SMART/ABCD Corrections

Unclear Objective: "Learners understand escalation."

Improved Objective: "By end of Module 1, learners identify escalation criteria correctly in 85% of practice scenarios."
