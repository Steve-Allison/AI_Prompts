# Learner_Outcomes_Instructions

## Purpose

Use this guide to produce high-quality Learning Gaps, Goals, Outcomes, and Objectives (GGOO) aligned to performance gaps and instructional best practice. All elements must follow SMART and ABCD principles.

## Required Inputs

- Course title/theme
- Clearly defined performance gap (baseline + target)

## Definitions & Examples

### Learning Gap – Why the course exists

Shortfall in job performance (e.g., agents resolve only 50% of issues on first call).

- Include: action, baseline, target, root cause, business risk
- Analogy: Diagnosis

**Example:**  
Current satisfaction score: 70% (target: 85%)  
Cause: Weak troubleshooting  
Impact: Risk of churn

### Learning Goal – Strategic vision

Big-picture aim that addresses the gap and links to business needs.

- Analogy: Vision

**Example:**  
Equip support agents to improve satisfaction from 70% → 85% within 3 months.

### Learning Objective – In-course performance

What learners will do by the end of training.

- Must follow ABCD (Audience, Behaviour, Condition, Degree)
- Must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Align with goal and assessment

**Example:**  
Given realistic scenarios (Condition), agents (Audience) will troubleshoot effectively (Behaviour) in 90% of simulations (Degree).

### Learning Outcome – Post-course impact

Real-world improvement measured after training.

- Must include: action, KPI, data source, timeframe

**Example:**  
Within 30 days, agents increase first-call resolution from 50% → 75% (dashboard-verified).

## Validation Checklist

- Gap linked to measurable need?
- Goal solves gap?
- Objective follows ABCD/SMART?
- Outcome is observable/measurable?
