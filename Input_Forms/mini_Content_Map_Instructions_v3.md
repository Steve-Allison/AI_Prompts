# Content Map – Minimal Instruction Set

## 1. What Is a Content Map?

A visual or tabular tool that aligns learning goals with topics, activities, and delivery methods. Ensures every element supports measurable learning objectives.

---

## 2. Core Functions

- **Aligns Objectives to Content** – Each objective maps to content and activities.
- **Ensures Logical Flow** – Foundation before complexity; avoids gaps or repetition.
- **Enables Collaboration** – A reviewable outline for SMEs and stakeholders.
- **Supports Planning** – Flags time, tools, and updates across course delivery.

## 3. Content Map Structure

Recommended as a table or visual layout with these core columns:

| Column                      | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Topics**              | Concepts learners need to know                          |
| **Learning Objectives**     | Actions learners will perform (see Learner Outcomes v3) |
| **Learning Outcomes**       | Measurable post-training change                         |
| **Learning Activities**     | Tasks to apply content (e.g., scenarios, journals)      |
| **Resources & Delivery**    | Tools, formats, timing, accessibility                   |
| **Assessments (optional)**  | Quizzes, projects, performance checks                   |
| **Theory (optional)**       | Supporting pedagogy (e.g., Gagné, Bloom)                |
| **Dependencies (optional)** | Required prerequisites or content links                 |

## 4. Required Top-Level Info

Include before your map table:

- **Course Title**
- **Creation Date**
- **Modality**
- **Duration**
- **Target Audience**
- **Module Learning Goal**
- **Module Learning Objective**

---

## 5. Design Applications

- **Build lesson plans** and media directly from the map.
- **Avoid duplication** by tracking activities and resources.
- **Prototype or pilot** high-priority sections first.
- **Apply UDL/accessibility** from the start.
- **Align objectives and assessments** to enable evaluation.

---

## 6. Tips for Use

- Use clear, action-based language for objectives.
- Keep the map concise and update as content evolves.
- Involve stakeholders early in the design process.

## 7. Summary

A well-structured Content Map connects every topic and task to course goals, reduces waste, supports inclusive design, and ensures consistent quality from planning to delivery.
