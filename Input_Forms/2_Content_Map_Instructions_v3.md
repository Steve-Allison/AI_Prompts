# Instruction for Creating Content Maps

Below is a synthesised explanation of the role and structure of the Content Map as outlined in your Digital
Learning Institute (DLI) materials. It draws together the key points from your sources into one cohesive
overview, highlighting why the Content Map is crucial for designing effective digital learning experiences and
how to build one in practice.

## 1. What Is the Content Map?

In the Digital Learning Institute documents, a Content Map (or curriculum Plan) is described as a visual or
tabular tool that aligns your high-level objectives (the “big picture” learning goals) with the detailed content
(actual topics, tasks, and media). By laying out everything in one place—from learning outcomes to delivery
methods—the Content Map ensures each segment of the course ties explicitly back to measurable objectives.

### 1.1 Why It Matters

It connects what is taught with why it is taught and where it fits in the overall course flow.
It reveals any gaps or redundancies, making sure the learning experience is cohesive and purposeful.

## 2. Role of the Content Map

### 2.1 Aligning Objectives, Content & Activities

Each learning objective (for definitions see: Learner Outcomes – Instructions v3) is paired with the specific
content or activities that will enable learners to achieve it. This ensures every piece of learning material has a
clear purpose and helps answer the question, “Why are we teaching this?”

### 2.2 Ensuring Logical Sequence

Because the map lays out modules or units in a visual or linear format, it is easier to confirm that foundational
knowledge appears before more advanced content or final assessments.

### 2.3 Preventing Gaps & Overlaps

Placing all modules, topics, and activities side by side makes it easier to spot:
 ▪Gaps: where an objective is not fully covered.
 ▪Overlaps: where the same content is repeated unnecessarily.

### 2.4 Facilitating Collaboration & Stakeholder Review

As a simple, high-level reference, the Content Map helps subject matter experts, sponsors, and other stakeholders
quickly review and approve the structure or provide targeted feedback.

### 2.5 Planning & Updating

Resource Requirements: By identifying specific activities, media, and platforms, the Content Map makes
resource planning (time, budget, tools) more straightforward.

Iteration & Maintenance: After launch, the Content Map remains a living document that can be updated when
learning objectives evolve or new content is introduced.

## 3. Structure of the Content Map

While formats may vary (e.g., flowcharts, mind maps, or tables), the DLI approach typically suggests a tabular
or visual layout that includes at least four main “columns” or sections. Here is a concise overview:

### 3.1 Key Topics/Content

The essential knowledge or concepts learners need to meet each objective.
May include reference materials, conceptual frameworks, or “need to know” information.

### 3.2 Learning Objectives

Learning Objectives – see ‘Learner Outcomes – Instructions v3’ for definition and writing guidance

### 3.3 Learning Outcomes

Learning Outcomes – see ‘Learner Outcomes – Instructions v3’.

### 3.4 Learning Activities

The tasks or exercises through which learners engage with or apply the content.
Examples include scenario-based challenges, group discussions, quizzes, or reflective journals.

### 3.5 Resources & Delivery Methods

The specific tools and formats used to deliver the learning (e.g., LMS platforms, video presentations, collaborative
boards).
May include time estimates (e.g., “10 minutes for a video”) and assessment details.
Additional Optional Elements could include:
 ▪Assessment Method: Quizzes, tests, or projects that measure if learners have met each objective.
 ▪Theory or Rationale: Mention of learning theories or design principles.
 ▪Dependencies/Prerequisites: If a topic requires prior knowledge or pre-work, note it here.

## 4. Content Map Structure

Module 1 should always be the introductory module:
 ▪explaining what the course is about
 ▪why it matters (from the perspective of the Learner)
 ▪scope of the course – what will and will not be covered

 ▪links to other relevant courses

### 4.1 Required structure of the Content Map

Note:
In the table, the Duration = duration of that module/topic/subtopic

## 5. How the Content Map Supports Design & Development

### 5.1 Starting Point for Detailed Design

Once the Content Map is complete, it acts as a guide for creating storyboards, lesson plans, or detailed
eLearning modules.

### 5.2 Guiding Resource Creation

Designers and SMEs can see exactly what content must be developed, preventing duplication and clarifying
resource needs.

### 5.3 Informing Prototyping

If you plan to pilot or prototype certain modules first, the map helps identify high-priority or high-risk areas.

### 5.4 Ensuring UDL & Accessibility

By embedding accessibility considerations in the Content Map (e.g., multiple representation formats), you
ensure every module is inclusive.

### 5.5 Setting the Stage for Evaluation

Clearly mapping each objective to its assessment method helps determine how the course’s success (e.g.,
knowledge gain, skill proficiency) will be measured.

## 6. Practical Tips

### 6.1 Be Specific & Action-Focused

Use clear, performance-based language in each objective so that learners understand exactly what they are
expected to do or demonstrate.

### 6.2 Keep It Lean & Updated

The Content Map is intended as an at-a-glance reference rather than an exhaustive document—update it
iteratively as feedback or requirements change.

### 6.3 Collaborate with Stakeholders

Involve SMEs, sponsors, and instructors early, so their expertise is woven into the structure from the start.

## 7. Conclusion

The Content Map is both a strategic and a practical tool. It allows learning designers to maintain a clear line
of sight from what is being taught to why it matters, ensuring each module, activity, and assessment aligns with
measurable objectives. By preventing random or redundant coverage and enabling easy review and updates, the
Content Map underpins a focused, cohesive, and learner-centred design process.
